# WELCOME TO OUR P6 PROJECT :rocket: :rocket: :rocket: :rocket:

This is our 6th project in the Proffesional AZUBI Data Analytics program.
We have been building projects down from scratch on various topics.

Feel free to go about this **README.md** to get a good view of what this project P6 is all about.

# ABOUT PROJECT

## ML MODEL EMBEDDING USING FAST_API

Here we are given a dataset on a disease namely **sepssis**, which is dependent on some variables
namely --
0742623012 - complainant
0741295118 - Evans (Kitususru area)
**_ID_**-- number to represent patient ID
**_PRG_**-- Plasma glucose
**_PL_**-- Blood Work Result-1 (mu U/ml)
**_PR_**-- Blood Pressure (mm Hg)
**_SK_**-- Blood Work Result-2 (mm)
**_TS_**-- Blood Work Result-3 (mu U/ml)
**_M11_**-- Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
**_BD2_**-- Blood Work Result-4 (mu U/ml)
**_Age_**-- patients age (years)
**_Insurance_**-- If a patient holds a valid insurance card
**_Sepsis_**-- This is what we are tryingg to predict

Our task here is a classification problem, setting our stratify (y) to be our target column

# PROJECT AIMS :bulb: :bulb: :bulb:

Come up with the best ML model with a high accuracy
Save the model as a pickle file
embed the saved model in a .py file
Create a decorative output

# PROJECT RUBRICS :star: :star: :star:

1. Perform an EDA on the dataset
2. Do a QnA ,and a hypothesis testing
3. Run a number of models to get the best model on our dataset
4. Embed the model using FastAPI
5. Deploy the app() on Hugging face
